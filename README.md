# Rocket.Chat.Integrations

Rocket.Chat provides an extendable Webhook integration framework, what means that through incoming and outgoing Webhook scripts we can integrate with every other platform on the web.

Here you can find some Webhook scripts already written to integrate with applications we all know and love.

If you have any integration scripts written that are not already here, please feel free to contribute, send us your pull request.
